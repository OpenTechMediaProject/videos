Welcome to the open tech media project,
in this video i will show you why you should use Firefox Multi-Account Containers,
how you should use it and how you install it.

Multi-Account Containers is a Firefox add-on that lets you easily separate your browsing activities.

According to Mozilla, container tabs are like normal tabs however the sites you visit will have access to a separate slice of the browser's storage. This means your site preferences, logged in sessions, and advertising tracking data won't carry over to the new container. Likewise, any browsing you do within the new container will not affect your logged in sessions, or tracking data of your other containers.
